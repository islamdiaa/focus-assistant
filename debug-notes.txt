BUG INVESTIGATION: Task done not persisting after refresh

ROOT CAUSE FOUND:

The `appStateSchema` in dataRouter.ts is the Zod validation schema for the save endpoint.
It's MISSING several new fields that were added in V1.8.x:

1. Task schema missing:
   - `quarterly` recurrence option (only has daily/weekly/monthly/weekdays/none)
   - `quarterlyDayOfMonth` field
   - `quarterlyStartMonth` field

2. Pomodoro schema missing:
   - `linkedTasks` array (new multi-task linking)
   - Still only has `linkedTaskId` (old single-task field)

3. Entire `reminders` array is missing from appStateSchema

When the client sends state with these new fields, Zod strips them (or fails validation),
causing data loss on save. The server saves a stripped version, and on reload the changes are gone.

FIX: Update appStateSchema to include all new fields.
Also need to add `reminders` to emptyState.
